# r_multiply_baseline_data_quality_report
Data quality report for the HHS Multiply Baseline

Most of the code is obtained from @maxramirez84, from his repository:
https://github.com/maxramirez84/r_tiptop_midline_hhs_data_quality_report
This is due to the great similarities between the TIPTOP and MULTIPLY projects. A big thanks to MÃ¡ximo for letting me use his code and helping me.
